# Listing of true targets in the images
#
# After adding a new image to the training set, each target that
# should be found needs to be listed here.
#
# The e2e testing scripts will only test against images listed in
# this file and will test them in the order presented here.
#
# Both .jpg and .png images may be tested.
#
# Instructions
# -----------
#
# Filenames should simply be listed as path/to/image.jpg. Glob
# patterns are allowed for testing many files at once (for example
# something/img-*.png would match both something/img-0001.png and
# something/img-1337.png).
#
# Targets can have the following attributes (attributes not listed
# will simple be ignored):
#
#     x - The x position of the target in the image from 0 to 1.
#
#         An x value of 0 means the center of the target is all the
#         way to the left in the image, a value 0.5 is in the center,
#         and a value of 1 is all the way to the right.
#
#     y - The y position of the target in the image from 0 to 1.
#
#         An x value of 0 means the center of the target is all the
#         way at the bottom in the image, a value 0.5 is in the
#         center, and a value of 1 is all the way at the top.
#
#     position_tol - How much error is allowed for x and y.
#
#         Defaults to 0.05.
#
#     orientation - The orientation of the target from 0 to 359.
#
#         An orientation of 0 means the target is not rotated, an
#         orientation of 90 means it the top of the target points to
#         the right of the image.
#
#     orientation_tol - How much error is allowed for orientation.
#
#         Defaults to 15.
#
#     shape - The shape of the target.
#
#         Must be one of the following:
#             circle
#             semicircle
#             quarter_circle
#             triangle
#             square
#             rectangle
#             trapezoid
#             pentagon
#             hexagon
#             heptagon
#             octagon
#             star
#             cross
#
#     background_color - The main color of the target.
#
#         Must be one of the following:
#             white
#             black
#             gray
#             red
#             blue
#             green
#             yellow
#             purple
#             brown
#             orange
#
#      alphanumeric - The letter or number on the target.
#
#          May consist of one or more of the characters 0-9, A-Z,
#          a-z. Typically, this will only be one capital letter.
#
#      alphanumeric_color - The main color of the target.
#
#          Must be one of the following:
#              white
#              black
#              gray
#              red
#              blue
#              green
#              yellow
#              purple
#              brown
#              orange
#
# Images without targets:
#
#     Simply list the filename without defining any targets below it.
#
# Images with a single target:
#
#     The attributes can be listed just directly under the filename.
#
# Images with multiple targets:
#
#     The attributes should be listed in smaller objects in a list
#     under the filename.
#
# Example image with one target:
#
#     img-000001.jpg:
#         x: 0.1223
#         y: 0.6783
#         position_tol: 0.1
#         orientation: 44
#         orientation_tol: 20
#         shape: star
#         background_color: red
#         alphanumeric: R
#         alphanumeric_color: white
